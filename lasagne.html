        Warm the oven according to information on the package of the pasta
        sheets.
      </li>
      <li>Use the butter to grease the bowl (prevents sticking).</li>
      <li>
        Put some Béchamel sauce in the bowl (Be aware that you need more to
        cover off the last layer of Pasta, see step 9).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a layer of pasta sheets. You can break off some edges to make sure
        you can cover as much as possible of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Add some Bolognese sauce, the pasta should be covered.</li>
      <li>
        Add some Béchamel sauce (does not need to cover the Bolognese sauce).
      </li>
      <li>Add another layer of pasta sheets.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat the steps to create those layers until the bowl has around 0.5cm
        left (prevents dripping over the edge of the bowl).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the rest of the Béchamel sauce to cover the last layer of pasta.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the bowl with aluminium foil (keeps moisture in).</li>
      <li>Bake the Lasagne according to the instructions on the pasta.</li>
      <li>
        Take the foil away in the last 10 minutes and put the grated cheese on.
      </li>
      <li>
        When its done, take the Lasagne out, put the foil on again and let it
        rest for 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
